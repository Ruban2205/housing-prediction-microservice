This repository contains a microservice for predicting housing prices based on machine learning models.

## Overview

This microservice provides a REST API endpoint to predict housing prices. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical housing data to make predictions.

## Installation 

1. To run this microservice locally, follow these steps: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruban2205/housing-prediction-microservice.git
cd housing-prediction-microservice
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the microservice

```
python app.py
```

The microservice will start running locally at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Usage

**Endpoint**

- POST `/predict`

**Request Body**

The `/predict` endpoint expects a JSON object with the following format: 

```json
{
  "area": 1500,
  "rooms": 3,
  "age": 15
}
```

- `area` (integer): The area of the house in square feet.
- `rooms` (integer): The number of rooms in the house.
- `age` (integer): The age of the house in years.

**Response**

The endpoint responds with a JSON object containing the predicted price: 

```json
{
  "predicted_price": 250000
}
```
